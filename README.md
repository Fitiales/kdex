## About
The Kerbal Dust Experiment by masTerTorch is a replica of LADEEs LDEX instrument. It comes with an animated model and tons of results.

Inspired by the NASA mission LADEE. The objective of LADEE was to investigate the mysteries of the lunar atmosphere and the question of levitated lunar dust. It carried a scientific instrument called the Lunar Dust Experiment (LDEX). This instrument was an impact ionization dust detector. In this way it was possible to measure the density of dust particles.

Kerbals are known for impacts and collisions and since 0.22 they do science. KDEX combines impacts and science.

This part is giving you the opportunity to do more science.

Doing science the Kerbal way!
